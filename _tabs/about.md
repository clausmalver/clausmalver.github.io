Hey there! I’m Claus Malver. I’m all about cybersecurity and solving tricky problems. I thrive on challenges that push me out of my comfort zone, whether it’s locking down systems or finding creative tech solutions or attending CTF challenges.

When I’m not diving into cybersecurity, I’m busy tinkering with new IT projects. I love exploring the latest tech trends and getting hands-on with building networks and software.

Thanks for dropping by!
