# Setting up Ngrok to make a public python3 webserver (or catch a reverse shell)
Sometimes it’s useful to serve a small webserver to the internet, or, during a CTF competition, to catch a reverse shell. Normally, you wouldn’t open your computer to the open internet. Instead, you can use Ngrok. This small guide will take you through setting up Ngrok on an Ubuntu Desktop running 24.01 LTS.

## 1. Set up a Ngrok account
First, you need a Ngrok account. Visit [https://ngrok.com/](https://ngrok.com/) and sign up using your preferred method.  
To enable TCP connections, you must complete "Identity Verification" by adding a credit card in the Ngrok settings page. This step won’t cost you any money, but it acts as a safeguard against abuse.

## 2. Install Ngrok and add your auth token
Install Ngrok using the following command:

```bash
sudo snap install ngrok
```

Once installed, visit the [Ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken) to retrieve your auth token. Use the command provided in the dashboard to configure Ngrok, replacing `$YOUR_AUTHTOKEN` with your actual token:

```bash
ngrok config add-authtoken $YOUR_AUTHTOKEN
```

## 3. Start a webserver and serve it to the internet
1. Navigate to the directory you want to serve to the internet.  
2. Start the Python webserver using the following command, replacing `[PORTNUMBER]` with your desired port:

```bash
python3 -m http.server [PORTNUMBER]
```

3. Next, start the Ngrok connection. Make sure to use the same port as the webserver:

```bash
ngrok tcp [PORTNUMBER]
```

It should display something like this:
```bash
Session Status                online                                                         
Account                       [YOUR USER ACCOUNT] (Plan: Free)

Connections                   ttl     opn     rt1     rt5     p50     p90

```

## 4. You’re Done!
That’s it! You’ve successfully served a webserver to the internet (or set up the connection to catch a reverse shell).  

All you have to do it go to `7.tcp.eu.ngrok.io:14231` to be directed to your webserver.
